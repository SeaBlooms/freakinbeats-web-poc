{% block header_content %}
<p>Freakin' Beats is located in Denver, CO and dedicated to finding all the freaky beats worldwide. We aim to serve the Denver community and USA/Canada at large with beats for any dance floor, or any digger...for whatever they deem necessary. Local pickup/delivery is available for residents in the Denver Metro and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Items are not totally guaranteed in stock, we also sell locally to DJ's and at events. We do our best to stay on top of this but it is a challenge to be 100% accurate. With this said we recommend paying the invoice after all records confirmed found. We will always happily refund or exchange if the item is not found.</p>
